# Tenmo

Tenmo - A console app made to represent a money transferring app like Venmo. 
This app uses SQL databases including making the tables, connecting the tables and using DAO's on the server side of the app. 
The app also uses REST API's including controllers on the server side and Rest Template calls on the application side. 

Features: 
- As a User, you can pick from a list of other user to transfer money to, the transfer is then saved in the database to be viewed later. 
- As a User, you can view a list of transfers you were involved in and select a transfer to view more details on. 
- As a User, you can request money from another user, that user can then choose to either approve or deny the request which is then updated in the database.
